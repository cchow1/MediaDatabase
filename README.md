# mediadatabase
A place where you can store your impressions of books, movies, TV shows, and other 


## Background and How to Use
I'm an avid reader, TV show junkie, and moviegoer. However, I find that I forget a lot of the things that I've read and watched over time, which is especially a pity for the shows/books that left a huge impression on me. This is my solution! 
Just follow the instructions on the GUI and enjoy your media repository! 

## For the Future
Here is a list of changes I would like to make: 
* Change the Excel database to a real SQL database (MS Access is a differet bit size currently)
* Feature to allow updates to existing entries 
* Change to Python
