### Media Database
A place where you can store your impressions of books, movies, TV shows, and other 


# Background and How to Use
I'm an avid reader, TV show junkie, and moviegoer. However, I find that I forget a lot of the things that I've read and watched over time, which is especially a pity for the shows/books that left a huge impression on me. This is my solution! 
Just follow the instructions on the GUI and enjoy your media repository! 

# For the Future
I was unable to connect a Microsoft Access database to MATLAB due to differences in bit size. For the future, I want to rewrite this in Python and successfully connect to a media database in Microsoft Access, then use SQL queries to make searches.
